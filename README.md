# Games

This repository contains small games that I made for fun and, um, science.
Each directory contains the source code for a game and a readme that details
the process mostly meant for myself and those who stumbles upon this repository.
Please feel free to raise any questions and/or concerns as an Issue, I will
try my best to address them as quickly and detailed as possible.

## Flatris

Flatris is a Tetris clone made with React. The idea is obviously not novel but
it turns out that even the original name, Reactris, is four-year-far from novel
(see [this repository](https://github.com/jmorrell/reactris), for example) upon
a quick look on the Internet! In any case, it has to be done at least once so
here it is.

## 2048

2048 is a clone of the
[kind of original original](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/)
(it's a clone of a clone apparently) made with React. It is a relatively simple
game and the main goal is to practise making a mobile friendly web-app with
support for touch/swipe gestures.

This clone does not work on older devices as it uses CSS Grid and there is no
fallback. It could have been coded without CSS Grid but I wanted the practice
and, at the time of writing, I'm still not sure how I should feel about
providing fallback options eternally.
