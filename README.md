# Games

This repository contains small games that I made for fun and, um, science.
Each directory contains the source code for a game and a readme that details
the process mostly meant for myself and those who stumbles upon this repository.
Please feel free to raise any questions and/or concerns as an Issue, I will
try my best to address them as quickly and detailed as possible.

## Flatris

Flatris is a Tetris clone made with React. The idea is obviously not novel but
it turns out that even the original name, Reactris, is four-year-far from novel
(see [this repository](https://github.com/jmorrell/reactris), for example) upon
a quick look on the Internet! In any case, it has to be done at least once so
here it is.

## 2048

2048 is a clone of the original made with React. It is a relatively simple game
and the main goal is to practise making a mobile friendly web-app with support
for touch/swipe gestures.
